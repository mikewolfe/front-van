# Introduction {#sec-intro}

For Original Research Articles [@conference], Clinical Trial Articles
[@article], and Technology Reports [@patent], the introduction should
be succinct, with no subheadings [@book]. For Case Reports the Introduction
should include symptoms at presentation [@chapter], physical exams and lab
results [@dataset].


# Article types

For requirements for a specific article type please refer to the Article Types
on any Frontiers journal page. Please also refer to
[Author Guidelines](http://home.frontiersin.org/about/author-guidelines#Sections)
 for further information on how to organize your manuscript in the
required sections or their equivalents for your field

For Original Research articles, please note that the Material and Methods
section can be placed in any of the following ways: before Results, before
Discussion or after Discussion.

# Manuscript Formatting

## Heading Levels

There are 5 heading levels

## Level 2
### Level 3
#### Level 4
##### Level 5


## Equations
Equations should be inserted in editable format from the equation editor.

$$
\sum x+ y =Z
$${#eq-01}

## Figures
Frontiers requires figures to be submitted individually, in the same order as
they are referred to in the manuscript. Figures will then be automatically
embedded at the bottom of the submitted manuscript. Kindly ensure that each
table and figure is mentioned in the text and in numerical order. Figures must
be of sufficient resolution for publication 
[see here for examples and minimum requirements](https://www.frontiersin.org/about/author-guidelines#ImageSizeRequirements).
Figures which are not according to the guidelines will cause substantial delay
during the production process. Please see
[here](https://www.frontiersin.org/about/author-guidelines#FigureRequirementsStyleGuidelines)
for full figure guidelines. Cite figures as
@fig-1 and @fig-2.


### Permission to Reuse and Copyright
Figures, tables, and images will be published under a Creative Commons CC-BY
licence and permission must be obtained for use of copyrighted material from
other sources (including re-published/adapted/modified/partial figures and
images from the internet). It is the responsibility of the authors to acquire
the licenses, to follow any citation instructions requested by third-party
rights holders, and cover any supplementary charges.

## Tables
Tables should be inserted at the end of the manuscript. Please build your table
directly in LaTeX. Tables provided as jpeg/tiff files will not be accepted.
Please note that very large tables (covering several pages) cannot be included
in the final PDF for reasons of space. These tables will be published as
[Supplementary Material](http://home.frontiersin.org/about/author-guidelines#SupplementaryMaterial)
on the online article page at the time of acceptance. The author will
be notified during the typesetting of the final article if this is the case.

## International Phonetic Alphabet
To include international phonetic alphabet (IPA) symbols, please include the
following functions: Under useful packages, include:`\usepackage{tipa}` In the
main text, when inputting symbols, use the following format: `\text[symbolname]`
e.g. `\textgamma`. This may require some editing of the template to accomplish.

# Nomenclature

## Resource Identification Initiative
To take part in the Resource Identification Initiative, please use the
corresponding catalog number and RRID in your current manuscript. For more
information about the project and for steps on how to search for an RRID, please
click [here](http://www.frontiersin.org/files/pdf/letter_to_author.pdf).

## Life Science Identifiers
Life Science Identifiers (LSIDs) for ZOOBANK registered names or nomenclatural
acts should be listed in the manuscript before the keywords. For more
information on LSIDs please see
[Inclusion of Zoological Nomenclature](https://www.frontiersin.org/about/author-guidelines#Nomenclature)
section of the guidelines.


# Additional Requirements

For additional requirements for specific article types and further information
please refer to
[Author Guidelines](http://www.frontiersin.org/about/AuthorGuidelines#AdditionalRequirements).

# Conflict of Interest Statement {.unnumbered}
All financial, commercial or other relationships that might be perceived by the
academic community as representing a potential conflict of interest must be
disclosed. If no such relationship exists, authors will be asked to confirm the
following statement:

The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any
commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential
conflict of interest.

# Author Contributions {.unnumbered}

The Author Contributions section is mandatory for all articles, including
articles by sole authors. If an appropriate statement is not provided on
submission, a standard one will be inserted during the production process. The
Author Contributions statement must describe the contributions of individual
authors referred to by their initials and, in doing so, all authors agree to be
accountable for the content of the work. Please see
[here](https://www.frontiersin.org/about/policies-and-publication-ethics#AuthorshipAuthorResponsibilities)
for full authorship criteria.

# Funding {.unnumbered}
Details of all funding sources should be provided, including grant numbers if
applicable. Please ensure to add all necessary funding information, as after
publication this is no longer possible.

# Acknowledgments {.unnumbered}
This is a short text to acknowledge the contributions of specific colleagues,
institutions, or agencies that aided the efforts of the authors.

# Supplemental Data {.unnumbered}
[Supplementary Material](http://home.frontiersin.org/about/author-guidelines#SupplementaryMaterial) 
should be uploaded separately on submission, if there are Supplementary Figures,
please include the caption in the same file as the figure. LaTeX Supplementary
Material templates can be found in the Frontiers LaTeX folder.

# Data Availability Statement {.unnumbered}
The datasets [GENERATED/ANALYZED] for this study can be found in the [NAME OF
REPOSITORY] [LINK].

Many Frontiers journals use the numbered referencing system, to find the style and resources for the journal you are submitting to click [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/Design/pdf/Frontiers_Journal_style_table.pdf).

# Figure captions {.unnumbered .appendix}

Please be aware that for original research articles we only permit a combined
number of 15 figures and tables, one figure with multiple subfigures will count
as only one figure. Use this if adding the figures directly in the mansucript,
if so, please remember to also upload the files when submitting your article
There is no need for adding the file termination, as long as you indicate where
the file is saved. In the examples below the files (logo1.eps and logos.eps) are
in the Frontiers LaTeX folder If using *.tif files convert them to .jpg or .png

logo1.eps is required in the path in order to correctly compile front page
header.

You can include figures using a code fence
```{r}
#| label: fig-1
#| fig-cap: "Enter the caption for your figure here.  Repeat as  necessary for each of your figures"
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 50%
knitr::include_graphics("figs/logo1.pdf")
```

Or through pandoc syntax

![This is Figure2](figs/logo2.pdf){#fig-2 width=50%}


Note that this template does not support subcaptions and corresponding 
references.

If you don't add the figures in the LaTeX files, please upload them when
submitting the article. Frontiers will add the figures at the end of the
provisional pdf automatically. The use of LaTeX coding to draw
Diagrams/Figures/Structures should be avoided. They should be external callouts
including graphics.
